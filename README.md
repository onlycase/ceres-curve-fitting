## Curve Fitting 

This is an optimization whereby given a set of observations, a best fitting curve must be found. The data (observations) were generated by sampling the ground truth curve and adding gaussian noise. The observations were fitted using least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals (offset from the curve).

## method

The equation of the curve is y=exp(mx+c), and the gaussian noise added has a standard deviation of 0.5.


## to do

* options to output raw data or output iterations
* plotting groundtruth, observations, fitted curve
* robust curve fitting
